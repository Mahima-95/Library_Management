pig is a language to reduce LOC
sqoop is used to transfer data from RDBMS to HDFS and HDFS to RDBMS.

Moreover, because of several limitations on a single machine where a user cannot add multiple hardware (like ram, hard disk) to a single system and will be very complex to maintain the hardware when they are added to a single system. This procedure of adding multiple hardware to a single system is known as Vertical Scaling.

(in a single system its complex to maintain multiple h/w added in single system
but this process is called vertical scaling.)

for storage capacity and the processing power. system are connected with distributed architecture, it creates fast processing and storage of data.
 procedure of storing and processing data in a distributed architecture is known as Horizontal Scaling.

 In a database world horizontal-scaling is often based on partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data , in vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine.

With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool - Vertical-scaling is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit.

A good example for horizontal scaling is Cassandra , MongoDB .. and a good example for vertical scaling is MySQL - Amazon RDS (The cloud version of MySQL). It provides an easy way to scale vertically by switching from small to bigger machines. This process often involves downtime.

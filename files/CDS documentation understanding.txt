CDS-Content Data Store 
it provides storage facility of any type of data
image, xml, pdf and scanned documents
manipulate, process manage by CDS storage facilities.

CDS components-
>ingestion system(Java Web Interface to load data in batch and real time)
>Agent((its a Tesseract OCR(eletronically extract text from images and reuse it.)(and Tesseract improve OCR process).Agent processes the images, pdfs and scanned documents extract krne kelie and after that store it into HBase
Load structured data into Hive for aggregations, and Images file will be stored in candidate database, 
if size of data more than 10MB hai so wo HDFS me store hoga and HBase me uska metadata store hoga.otherwise, if size of data less than 10 MB h to wo direclty HBase MOB data type column store hoga.)
HBase MOB data type column is Hbase can handle data upto 10MB including binary data like images.
if HBase handle more than 10MB data so its performance is degraded  because of write amplification caused by splits and compactions..)
>Image and Data Store(HBase and HDFS)
>ML (meta language)
>UI
>d.	Reporting and Downstream
downstream is sent summarize aggregated data files to external system 
reporting system- jha users r directly connected or images ko retrieve krta h based on data fetched to app system.
